# Portfolio

## Description
 I was assigned to recreate a website from a reference photo. I started this as a challenge to myself to become more comfortable with flexbox. Although I couldnt mimic the way the original website behaves with flexbox, I was able get some of it as well as some of the other elements to work and recreate it's general aesthetic.

## Credits
Shout out to my tutor Scott, Teacher Lief, and naps.

## Notes
The next time I attempt this I think I will start with a mobile first approach and use media query to size it out for bigger screens. Unfortunately, I was too far along to start over and change my approach. I now have a greater understanding of flexbox and its properties, however, theres still more to work on and utilize.
